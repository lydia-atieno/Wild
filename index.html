      <h2>1. The Lion</h2>
      <div class="lion">In Swahili, a lion is called <b>Simba.</b><br>The scientific name for a lion is <b>Panthera leo.</b><br> They are the second largest big cats after tigers.<br> There are two surviving species of lions: <b>African lions and Asian lions</b>.<br>The young one of a lion is called a <b>cub.</b> <br>A group of lions is known as a <b>pride.</b> Tanzania has the largest population of lions in Africa.</div>
      <div class="img"><img src="https://github.com/lydia-atieno/Wild/blob/master/img/L5.jpg?raw=true" width="300" height="200"></div>
      <div class="facts">
        <ul>
        <li>Although the lion is known as "the king of the jungle", lions do not live in jungles. They live only in grasslands and plains.</li>
        <li>Lions come in different colors, including tan, brown, yellow and even red.</li>
        <li>In the wild, male lions live for 12-16years, lionesses live for about 15-18years. In captivity, male lions can live for over 20years.</li>
        <li>Only about 1 in 8 male lions survive to adulthood. A majority of lions die shortly after being kicked out of their pride around the age of 2.</li>
        <li>A lion's roar can be heard up to eight kilometres away.</li>
        <li>Unlike other cats, lions are great swimmers.</li>
        <li>They have a great sense of hearing.</li>
        <li>The lion is the most social of all big cats.</li>
        <li>Among all the big cats, lions nap the most, sleeping up to 22hours a day.</li>
        <li>Lion prides are usually decribed as matriarchal, with communal care for the young.  Most lionesses in a pride are related and remain in the same pride for life.Only two or three lions within a pride will be males, who are either brothers or pride-mates.</p>
        <li>A dominant male in a pride has two jobs. First, he must mate with all the females in the pride and second, he must defend the pride from other males who want to take over.</li>
        <li>Male lions may mate up to 100 times in two days to ensure that the female is pregnant. Each mating lasts only a few seconds. Female lions are pregnamt with their cubs for about three and a half months.</li>
        <li>The lion has a special tongue that is rough enough to peel the skin of their prey away from the flesh. If a lion licked the back of a human's hand a few times, it would peel away much of the skin.</li>
        <li>A lion's pupil is three times as big as human's</li>
        <li>A lion can't move its eyes side to side very well, so it moves its entire head when it needs to look in a different direction.</li>
        <li>Lions mostly hunt at night.</li>
        <li>Lions can see six times better in the dark than a human.</li>
        <li>Lions are not as fast as other big cats, they hunt using teamwork and rely more on strength than speed to catch and kill prey.</li>
        <li>Lionesses will often bring back a small animal such as a baby antelope alive so that the cub can practice their hunting skills.</li>
      </ul>
